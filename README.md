The repository is created to solve the following challenges using Javascript;
 1.  Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
 2.  Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
 3.  Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

## Challenge1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
The javascript program prompts the user to input student marks. It then makes sure that the input is within the range of 0 and 100 using the LOOP [while(true)] function. Using the [elseif] statement, the program checks through different range of student marks and prints out grades for the different inputs from users. The grades ranges considered are:
To display message to the screen with the student's grade window.alert is used. A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

## Challenge2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
The Speed detector program takes as input the speed of a car. It then makes sure that the input is within the range of 0 or a positive number using the LOOP [while(true)] function. While using [elseif] statement for speed points allocation, it checks the speed of the car and if it is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Else, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Challenge3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

The program calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits [grossSalary]. Using the [if] statement it validates the inputs of both basic salary and benefit.It also calculates the Gross Salary, Tax, NHIF Deduction, NSSF Deduction & Net Salary
